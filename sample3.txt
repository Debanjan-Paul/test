B0009B0IX4,5.0,Very comfortable. Noise reduction is better than the rest, wind noise a problem when driving with window down. long battery life.
B0009B0IX4,5.0,So easy to configure, great quality of ear phone and microphone.  Excellent bluetooth reception.  Long battery life.  I would definitely get a second one of this if I have another phone.
B0009B0IX4,2.0,The mouth piece cover came off after 6 months of normal use. It seems like some poor quality adhensive has been used to attach the mouth piece cover to the main body. See the custom pics I have uploaded on what happened to my device. Audio quality suffers badly without the mouth piece cover. I can tape the cover to the main body, but since it is under warranty, I will try to send it back. The device still works other wise. I will update with the outcome of trying to send this back to the reseller.6 months is too short a life-span for a blue tooth device. 2 stars.
B0009B0IX4,5.0,This headset is great!  It costs only a fraction of the fancy ones sold in most cellular stores, but offers far greater quality.  It easily links with my bluetooth phone, sits comfortably over my ear, and offers excellent reception and transmission even when I'm driving at highway speeds.
B0009B0IX4,4.0,Love the headset except for the fact that there are only 3 ear pieces in the box.  I have small ear holes and could use a smaller ear piece.  Other than that its great
B0009B0IX4,4.0,I have been very happy with this headset.  The quality is far superior to the Jabra headset I have used in the past.  The price is great - I fully reccomend.
B0009B0IX4,4.0,Overall the best bluetooth headset I have tried, excellent noise rejection and very clear reception. The one issue is with the charging connection on the headset, + voltage receptical is a small pin which in my experience can be easily pushed in or disconnected, extreme care must be taken when connecting the power, other than that a great headset.
B0009B0IX4,5.0,This is my fourth bluetooth and it is the best out of all of them. Sound is great and it fits around my ear perfectly.
B0009B0IX4,4.0,Very good sound quality but the on/off button is a real pain.  Good fit and a good buy with only that one negative.
B0009B0IX4,5.0,This is a great headset. It fits snuggly around the ear and the earbud fits inside the ear--it doesn't just hang beside your ear. This is my third Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth headset. I like it so much I keep buying the same one. I'm sure I would still be using my 1st or 2nd headset had I not washed and dryed them.
B0009B0IX4,5.0,As the title of my review says, this is the best bluetooth headset I've ever owned.  I have tried numerous headsets to see if they match a wired one in sound quality, including numerous Motorola and previous Plantronics sets.  This is the first headset that gives acceptable sound quality both sending and receiving on my Treo 700P.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a bluetooth headset, no matter what the price.
B0009B0IX4,5.0,Works well, good audio quality, battery lasts a long time.
B0009B0IX4,1.0,Headset has quite bad microphone; people complain much more than with my old Motorola Headset about the voice quality and amount of noise. Not worth the price.
B0009B0IX4,1.0,This thing worked fine for about a week! Now I have to constantly re-connect it to the phone and battery life is very short!!  Spend a little more and get your moneys worth.
B0009B0IX4,5.0,This is the best Bluetooth headset that I have used. The audio quality is great, with good cancellation of background noise. The operation is intuitive - I especially like the ability to mute a call from the headset. I use the headset with two different phones with no problems.
B0009B0IX4,1.0,This product has a terrible connection, is bulky, doesnt fit on my ear, has small buttons and I never use it.  BAD PURCHASE
B0009B0IX4,4.0,I have been using this product for a month now.  For the most part it works well although the reception at home and in my office is not that great.The reception problem existed prior to this purchase. Overall, this item has given me the freedom to multitask (with both hands) while talking on the phone. Excellent value for the price!
B0009B0IX4,4.0,This unit is very comfortable. Sound quality on both ends is good. Standby and talk time are good. Only complaint is connect time is slow. Averaging 2.5-3 seconds after you press the button to answer. (Undoubtedly, because of being only BT v1.2.)
B0009B0IX4,3.0,This headset sounds great, fits well, and has great volume--but it does not work with Cisco IP Communicator (VoIP), and the on/off button is extremely difficult to use, especially if you're in the car.  If you have big fingers, forget it.
B0009B0IX4,5.0,It is comfortable, stable on your ear, and very loud and clear sound quality.  There is only one other better Plantronics Bluetooth headset that is possessedly more advanced (655).  But I am extremely happy with this one, as it retails for about $50.  You can even buy aditional equipment and this headset can be used in your office or home with a regular land line as well.  Not only for cellular.  Awesome!
B0009B0IX4,5.0,I've been thru a few headsets. This one is solid and has great sound. I'm really happy with it.
B0009B0IX4,5.0,I ahve been using the Voyager 510 for about a year now.  the way you can switch between the cell phone and my desktop phone, makes it by far the best headset I have used.
B0009B0IX4,2.0,I bought this due to the good reviews on this website and have had numerous complaints from business associates and family that my voice is muffled and hard to hear with this headset.  I have had better success with my cheaper Motorola.
B0009B0IX4,2.0,I just recently purchased my voyager and was forced to return it after 1 week because of the number of complaints regarding poor transmission sound quality. I have used other plantronics bluetooths before but I must admit this one let me down.On the plus side, pairing was as easy as can be and using the volume and control buttons did not pose any difficulty.
B0009B0IX4,4.0,Not complaining about the seller at all, because there is nothing to complain about. The headset, on the other hand, is mediocre. That is because even when you are standing next to the phone there is still some static. the range of clear call is about a medium sized room. I suppose that there is a way to hang up a call and use voice dialing through the headset, but couldn't figure it out yet.
B0009B0IX4,1.0,The ear piece and loop are very large and cumbersome and difficult to adjust for both ears.Seemed ok at first but kept losing my bluetooth connection this Treo and finally crapped out completely.Will return and try again.
B0009B0IX4,1.0,This was a complete waste of money.  It runs flat after oh, about an hour, even when not being used.  And the audio quality is so bad you're better off not using it anyway.  I've tried using it with a blackberry and a Mac, and  in both cases I've disconnected it because the quality was so bad.
B0009B0IX4,3.0,The sound coming out from the headset is kind of soft, and the fit of the headset is somewhat loose.
B0009B0IX4,3.0,Item does work well as far as sound quality and setup ease. However ear loop is basically not adjustable at all, consequently making the ear piece itself to constantly work its way out of my ear and feel as if it were just hanging there... After days of pushing ear piece back into my ear canal and hoping the loop would give a bit. i returned it for exactly those reasons... Great sound quality and no one i spoke to claimed to hear any distortion. just didn't fit well with no possible adjusting available...
